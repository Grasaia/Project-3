    <h2>Football</h2>
      <p>Originated in the 19th century</p>

      <p>A small summary on football:</p>
      <p>Football originates from rugby and soccer and was made its own thing by americans</p>
      <p>In football there are two teams each with 11 players on the field at a time the attacking team must reach the ball to the other side of the 100 yard field whilst the defensive team attempts to prevent this</p>
      <p>The offense revolves around the center who gives the ball to the quarterback to start the play the quarterback then 1. passess the ball to another 2. runs or 3. throws the ball down the field</p>
      <p>The defense on the other hand is composed of different numbers of linebackers, defensive ends and defensive tackles, all attempting to block runs and passes or break through the offensive line to tackle, or "sack," the quarterback before he releases the ball.</p>
      <p>For the rules of the game, it is divided into four quarters, each measuring 15 minutes in length. Each half of the game begins with a kickoff, with one team kicking the ball up the field from its own 30-yard line and the other attempting to catch and run with the ball as far as possible. If the kick receiver is tackled or goes out of bounds, a first down is called.</p>
      <p>and lastly when it comes to scoring, if the offensive team is able to either run or pass the ball into the other team's end zone, it is credited with a touchdown and awarded 6 points. This is followed by an extra point attempt from the defending team's 2-yard line, with a kick through the uprights adding 1 point and a run or pass into the end zone adding 2 points</p>
      <p>There is so much more to football beyond what I'm talking about but going over it would be way to time consuming</p>
